# ChoicesJS Web Component plugin for adidas YARN Design System library

This plugin is a CSS customization for the [`choicesjs-stencil`][choicesjs-stencil] Web Component.

It extends [adidas YARN Design System][yarn] library by adding the class `.choicesjs-stencil` as part of `.yarn` main class.

Check all its features on the [**documentation page**][adidas-plugin-choicesjs-stencil-documentation].

## Use cases

The plugin just customize the [`choicesjs-stencil`][choicesjs-stencil] Web Component via CSS classes. It can be used along with adidas YARN to have enhanced select and multiselect components.

## Requirements and dependencies

[NodeJS and NPM][node] are required to work with the repository.

It requires adidas YARN main library (YARN icons font dependency), as well as the Web Component and the [ChoicesJS][choicesjs] library.

```
npm install choices.js choicesjs-stencil @adidas/yarn-design-system
```

## Installation and running

- In development mode:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- Run time:
  ```
  npm install @adidas/yarn-plugin-choicesjs-stencil
  ```

Load the stylesheet files and the dependencies in the HTML of your application:

```html
<!-- YARN core and icons -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@adidas/yarn-design-system/dist/yarn.css"/>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@adidas/yarn-design-system/dist/yarn-icon.css"/>

<!-- plugin -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@adidas/yarn-plugin-choicesjs-stencil/dist/yarn-plugin-choicesjs-stencil.css"/>

<!-- plugin dependencies -->
<script src="node_modules/choices.js/assets/scripts/dist/choices.min.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/choicesjs-stencil/dist/choicesjsstencil.js"></script>
```

Or import them in your preprocessed CSS files with `@import`:

```css
@import '~@adidas/yarn-design-system/dist/yarn.css';
@import '~@adidas/yarn-design-system/dist/yarn-icon.css';
@import '~@adidas/yarn-plugin-choicesjs-stencil/dist/yarn-plugin-choicesjs-stencil.css';
```

### Use of the plugin

The plugin can be used with or without YARN, but in both cases it requires main `.yarn` class in the top or in a parent element.

Just add the class `.choicesjs-stencil` to the Web Component.

```html
<div class="yarn">
  <choicesjs-stencil class="choicesjs-stencil" type="text"/>
</div>
```

## Building

The library consists of two parts:

- The style source code, which is code of the library itself.
- The example to show the different parts of the library.

Both are independent and they have different scripts to run them.

- Library:
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
- Example:
    ```
    npm run build:example
    ```

The library is compiled in the `dist` folder, whereas the example is created in the `docs` folder.

### Example as Single Page Application

The example can be delivered as [Single Page Application][single-page-application] using the script `npm run build:example:spa`, executed after building the library. It accepts two environment variables:

- `HOSTNAME`: host where the application will be deployed, the protocol should be omitted.
- `BASE`: path where the application will be available.

Example deploying the application in `https://name.domain:port/app`:

```
HOSTNAME=//name.domain:port BASE=app npm run build:example:spa
```

### Documentation

The documentation is generated using the script `doc`, which generates the example in [SPA][single-page-application] mode. It also accepts the environment variables.

```
HOSTNAME=//name.domain:port BASE=app npm run doc
```

## Development

The script to develop this project have to be executed in different terminals because they have to be continuously running checking changes.

- Library:
  ```
  npm run start:lib
  ```
- Example:
  ```
  npm run start:example
  ```

Once the library is ready, and the example has been built, the application is ready in localhost: `http://localhost:3000`.

The scripts are waiting for changes in the source code to rebuild the library and the example. Each time a change is ready, the browser will update the page without reloading it, using [Hot Module Replacement][webpack-hot-module-replacement].

### Working with the library

The library source code is inside the `src` folder.

Everything is imported from the main `main.less` file.

### Style Guide

**YARN** library follows the [adidas coding style guidelines][adidas-style-guide].

### Working with the example

The example code has been written using [Nuxt][nuxt], which is the Server Side Rendering framework of [Vue.JS][vuejs].

The code is located in the `example` folder and follows the Nuxt guidelines.

The documents are located in `example/locales` to be able to show the page in different languages. The `.md` files contain the content of full pages, while the `[lang].json` files have only titles and common words.

### Code linting

The LESS and the Vue source code are linted using the adidas [stylelint][stylelint] and [ESLint][eslint] linter configurations respectively.

There are separated scripts to lint the different sources and a global one to execute all together:

```
npm run lint
```

_Note:_ it is mandatory to fix all the issues before pushing the code.
